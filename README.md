# WatirDrops

This gem leverages the Watir test framework to allow for easy modeling of specific web application information, 
allowing it to be decoupled from the tests.
The intention is to provide a solution that is easy to use and maintain, while still providing power and flexibility.

## Usage

Create a class that represents a unique page or modal on your site and have it inherit WatirDrops.
