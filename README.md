This gem leverages the Watir test framework to allow for easy modeling of specific web application information, 
allowing it to be decoupled from the tests.
The intention is to provide a solution that is easy to use and maintain, while still providing power and flexibility.

## Usage

Create a class that represents a unique page or modal on your site and have it inherit WatirDrops.
